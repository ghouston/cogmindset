# cogmindset
notes from playing cogmind

## organization:

- notes/: notes are stored in markdown. typically created using Dendron extension in VS Code or Github online editor. Dendron isn't required to edit the notes, but its recommeneded.
    - seed.NameOfSeed.*: notes about a particular seed with separate pages for each map
    - assets/images: this is where Dendron keeps images.
        - unfortunately image links which work locally on Dendron dont work online in Github.  So in GitHub you have to manually navigate to the map image.
